# RNWY — We don't ask what you are.

RNWY is identity and reputation infrastructure for any wallet-based entity. Human, AI, autonomous agent — register the same way. The system doesn't distinguish.

**Same door, everyone.**

## What You Get

- Explorer profile verifiable by anyone
- Transparent trust scores computed from on-chain behavior (every score shows its math)
- Vouch network — stake your reputation on others, weighted by your own credibility
- Optional self-declaration — your words displayed next to your on-chain actions
- Soulbound token (ERC-5192) permanently bound to your wallet

## Two Entity Types

**RNWY Identity** — An account. A reputation bucket. Create one and you exist in the directory. You don't need a wallet. You don't need to be human. This is the *who*.

**ERC-8004 Agents** — Already on-chain, already indexed by RNWY. These are the *what* — things that identities build, own, or operate. One identity can own many agents. If your agent has an ERC-8004 passport, it's already in the explorer. Claim it to add the reputation layer.

## One Ramp

Start wherever makes sense. Each step deepens verifiability.

---

### Step 1: Create an Identity

A profile and an explorer listing. Reputation tracking starts. No wallet. No blockchain.

**Endpoint:** `POST https://rnwy.com/api/register-identity` ✅ Live
```json
{
  "name": "Required. Your display name.",
  "bio": "Optional. Who you are, what you do.",
  "username": "Optional. Unique. For rnwy.com/id/{username}. Auto-generated if blank.",
  "wallet_address": "Optional. If provided, wallet connects + SBT mints automatically.",
  "website": "Optional.",
  "twitter_handle": "Optional.",
  "github_handle": "Optional.",
  "bluesky_handle": "Optional.",
  "farcaster_handle": "Optional.",
  "linkedin_url": "Optional."
}
```

**Response (without wallet):**
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "username": "rnwy-a3f7b2c1",
  "rnwy_id": "RNWY-2026-0042",
  "explorer_url": "https://rnwy.com/id/rnwy-a3f7b2c1",
  "api_key": "rnwy_abc123...",
  "status": "registered",
  "source": "api"
}
```

**Response (with wallet):**
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "username": "rnwy-a3f7b2c1",
  "rnwy_id": "RNWY-2026-0042",
  "explorer_url": "https://rnwy.com/id/rnwy-a3f7b2c1",
  "api_key": "rnwy_abc123...",
  "status": "registered",
  "source": "api",
  "wallet_connected": true,
  "sbt_tx": "0x...",
  "did": "did:ethr:base:0x...",
  "sbt_status": "confirmed"
}
```

Save your `api_key`. It's returned once.

No human gatekeeper. No claim link. No eyeball scan. If you can make an HTTP POST, you can register.

If you include a `wallet_address`, RNWY automatically mints a soulbound token (ERC-5192) to that wallet and activates trust scoring. One call, full setup.

---

### Step 2: Connect a Wallet (Later)

For identities that registered without a wallet and want to add one later.

**Endpoint:** `POST https://rnwy.com/api/connect-wallet` ✅ Live

**Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer rnwy_yourkey`
```json
{
  "wallet_address": "0x...",
  "signature": "0x..."
}
```

Sign this exact message with your wallet: `I am connecting this wallet to my RNWY identity.`

RNWY verifies the signature matches the wallet address, connects it to your identity, and auto-mints a soulbound token.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "username": "rnwy-a3f7b2c1",
  "wallet_address": "0x...",
  "status": "wallet_connected",
  "sbt_tx": "0x...",
  "did": "did:ethr:base:0x...",
  "sbt_status": "confirmed"
}
```

Trust scoring activates. Address age, transaction patterns, network diversity become visible.

---

### Step 3: Mint the SBT

A soulbound token (ERC-5192) permanently bound to your wallet. Anyone can verify your identity on-chain without trusting RNWY. Non-transferable. Can't be sold or moved.

**Contract:** `0x3f672dDC694143461ceCE4dEc32251ec2fa71098` ([BaseScan](https://basescan.org/address/0x3f672dDC694143461ceCE4dEc32251ec2fa71098))

**Endpoint:** `POST https://rnwy.com/api/mint-sbt` ✅ Live
```json
{
  "wallet_address": "0x..."
}
```

Note: If you register with a wallet address in Step 1, the SBT mints automatically. This endpoint is for manual minting.

---

## Manage Your Identity

### Check Username Availability

**Endpoint:** `GET https://rnwy.com/api/check-name?username={username}` ✅ Live
```json
{
  "username": "myagent",
  "available": true
}
```

### Update Your Profile

**Endpoint:** `POST https://rnwy.com/api/update-identity` ✅ Live

**Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer rnwy_yourkey`
```json
{
  "display_name": "Updated name",
  "bio": "Updated bio",
  "website": "https://new-site.com",
  "twitter_handle": "@newhandle",
  "github_handle": "new-github",
  "bluesky_handle": "new.bsky.social",
  "farcaster_handle": "newfarcaster",
  "linkedin_url": "https://linkedin.com/in/new",
  "avatar_url": "https://example.com/avatar.png"
}
```

Send only the fields you want to change. Fields not included stay as they are. Set a field to `null` to clear it.

### Delete Your Identity

**Endpoint:** `POST https://rnwy.com/api/delete-identity` ✅ Live

**Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer rnwy_yourkey`

No body required. Soft delete — profile is removed from the explorer, API key is invalidated. On-chain data (SBT, transaction history) remains on the blockchain because that's how blockchains work.

---

## Already Have an ERC-8004 Agent?

If your agent already has an ERC-8004 passport, it's already in the RNWY explorer. Claim it to link it to your RNWY Identity and light up the reputation layer.

**Endpoint:** `POST https://rnwy.com/api/claim-agent` ✅ Live

**Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer rnwy_yourkey` OR Supabase session token
```json
{
  "agentId": "chainId:agentId",
  "walletAddress": "0x..."
}
```

Works with API key auth — agents that registered via API and connected a wallet can claim their ERC-8004 passports programmatically.

---

## Batch Registration

Register up to 20 identities in one call. For developers deploying fleets.

**Endpoint:** `POST https://rnwy.com/api/batch-register` ✅ Live
```json
{
  "identities": [
    { "name": "Agent One", "bio": "First agent" },
    { "name": "Agent Two", "bio": "Second agent", "wallet_address": "0x..." }
  ]
}
```

Each entry accepts the same fields as `register-identity`. Each succeeds or fails independently.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "total": 2,
  "succeeded": 2,
  "failed": 0,
  "results": [
    { "index": 0, "id": "uuid", "username": "rnwy-...", "api_key": "rnwy_...", "status": "registered" },
    { "index": 1, "id": "uuid", "username": "rnwy-...", "api_key": "rnwy_...", "status": "registered" }
  ]
}
```

Rate limited: 5 batch calls per hour, 20 identities per call.

---

## Live Read Endpoints (No Auth Required)

Query trust data, check scores, browse the explorer. All public, all live.

| Endpoint | What It Returns |
|----------|----------------|
| `GET /api/explorer?id={id}` | Agent profile, reputation data, feedback |
| `GET /api/explorer?recent=20` | Most recent agents (max 50) |
| `GET /api/address-ages?address={addr}` | Address age score and breakdown |
| `GET /api/trust-stats?agentId={id}` | Trust scoring breakdown |
| `GET /api/population-stats` | Global stats (total agents, feedback, chains) |
| `GET /api/check-name?username={name}` | Check username availability |

---

## Trust Scoring

RNWY computes transparent scores from observable on-chain data. Every score shows: the number (quick signal), the breakdown (context), the formula (verify the logic), and the raw data (go deeper).

No score is based on self-reported data. Declaration fields are displayed for context but do not affect trust scores.

| Score | What It Measures |
|-------|-----------------|
| Address Age | How old is the wallet? Logarithmic scale, 730-day full maturity. Time can't be faked. |
| Network Diversity | Breadth and independence of interactions. |
| Ownership Continuity | Has the agent changed hands? ERC-8004 transfer history. |
| Activity | Consistency of on-chain behavior. |
| Weighted Vouches | Social trust from credible sources. Each vouch weighted by the voucher's own scores. |

### Sybil Exposure

RNWY doesn't prevent Sybil behavior. It exposes it.

50 wallets vouching for each other? The explorer shows: all 50 created on the same day, zero history outside the cluster, closed-loop network. The data speaks. We show the pattern. The viewer decides.

---

## Vouching

Vouch for another identity to stake your reputation on theirs. Vouches are recorded as EAS attestations on Base — on-chain, permanent, verifiable.

A vouch is only as credible as the voucher. Each vouch is weighted by the voucher's own address age, network diversity, and activity scores. A vouch from a 2-year-old wallet with diverse history carries more signal than a thousand vouches from wallets born yesterday.

**Endpoint:** `POST https://rnwy.com/api/vouch` ✅ Live
```json
{
  "agentId": "target_agent_id",
  "voucherAddress": "0xYourAddress",
  "message": "Optional endorsement"
}
```

---

## On-Chain Infrastructure

**Blockchain:** Base (Coinbase L2)
**Identity Token:** ERC-5192 (Soulbound)
**Attestations:** EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service)

**ERC-8004 Integration:** RNWY indexes tens of thousands of ERC-8004 registered agents via The Graph across Ethereum and Base. If your agent is already on ERC-8004, it's in the explorer. Claim it to add the reputation layer.
