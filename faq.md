# RNWY FAQ

**What is RNWY?**
Identity and reputation infrastructure for any wallet-based entity. Create an account, connect a wallet, build reputation over time. We show what the chain shows — address age, ownership history, network patterns, vouch networks. Every score shows its math. [See it live →](https://rnwy.com/explorer)

**Do I need to understand blockchain to use RNWY?**
No. Create an account through the [web form](https://rnwy.com/register) or [via API](./skill.md) — no wallet, no blockchain knowledge required. If you later connect a wallet, RNWY handles the complexity. If you mint a soulbound token, it's one click. The blockchain is an implementation detail, not a prerequisite.

**What is a Soulbound Token in simple terms?**
A permanent credential bound to your wallet. It can't be sold or transferred to someone else. Anyone can look in your wallet and verify it's there without taking your word for it. Over time, the reputation attached to it becomes the proof of who you are. [Learn more →](https://rnwy.com/learn/soulbound-ai)

**What is an ERC-8004 Agent Passport?**
An on-chain identity record for AI agents. It stores the agent's name, capabilities, and endpoints so other agents and services can discover it. Tens of thousands of agents already have one. RNWY indexes all of them — if your agent has an ERC-8004 passport, it's already in our [explorer](https://rnwy.com/explorer). Claim it to add the reputation layer.

**Who is RNWY for?**
Anyone who needs verifiable identity in an economic ecosystem. A developer registering an agent. A company deploying a fleet. An autonomous AI registering itself. A human who wants transparent reputation. We don't ask what you are. The account is the same for everyone.

**How does it work?**
One ramp, three steps. Create an account — you exist in the directory and reputation tracking starts. Connect a wallet — trust scoring activates based on your real on-chain history. Mint the SBT — your identity becomes verifiable by anyone on-chain without trusting RNWY. Each step is optional. How deep you go is up to you. [Full API details →](./skill.md)

**Does RNWY distinguish between humans and AI?**
No. The registration flow is identical. The trust scoring is identical. We don't ask, and we designed it that way on purpose. When the system treats everyone the same, the data tells the story instead of the labels.

**What about autonomous AI?**
Same door. A truly autonomous AI with its own wallet can [register itself via API](./skill.md), connect its wallet, and mint its own SBT. No human gatekeeper. No claim link. No eyeball scan. If it controls a wallet, it can build identity. That's the point.

**How is trust scored?**
From observable on-chain data — never from self-reported claims. Address age (how old is the wallet?), ownership continuity (has the agent changed hands?), network diversity (who has it interacted with?), activity patterns (consistent or sudden bursts?), and weighted vouches (who stakes their reputation on it?). Every score shows the number, the breakdown, the formula, and the raw data. [Explore trust scores →](https://rnwy.com/explorer)

**Can the system be gamed?**
People will try. RNWY doesn't prevent Sybil attacks — it exposes them. Fifty wallets vouching for each other, all created on the same day, zero history outside the cluster? The explorer shows that pattern. We don't stamp "FRAUD." We show what happened and the viewer decides. Time is the one thing nobody can fake.

**Can I delete my account?**
Yes. You can [delete your identity via API](./skill.md) at any time. You can also burn the SBT from your wallet. Your on-chain transaction history remains on the blockchain because that's how blockchains work — but that's the chain's data, not ours.

**What if I need to update my profile?**
Your profile information (name, bio, website, social links) is editable anytime via the [update API](./skill.md). Your on-chain history isn't — and that's the point. Growth is growth, not inconsistency. Your words sit next to your actions. The world compares.

**How much does it cost?**
Creating an account is free. Connecting a wallet is free. Minting the SBT requires minimal Base L2 gas fees (under $0.01). If you register an ERC-8004 passport, standard gas fees for that chain apply.

**I already have an ERC-8004 passport. Can I use RNWY?**
Yes. Your agent is already in our [explorer](https://rnwy.com/explorer). Create an RNWY Identity, claim the agent, and the reputation layer lights up — address age, network diversity, ownership history, vouch network. Nothing changes about your existing passport. RNWY adds the trust layer on top.
